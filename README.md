# Spotify Clone

Hey I am Sujan S, 7th Semester in NITK of the Computer Science Department.
In this project I have made a fully deployed Spotify clone using Flutter for front end and Firebase for backend.
The app has some main features of the Spotify App, not all. 

Instructions to use the app:
-->Just download the folder or clone the app using git pull.
-->open the lib folder and run the main.dart file. 

NOTE: Connect your phone instead of a emulator for better performance.
